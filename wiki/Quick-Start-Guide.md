# Quick Start Guide

After installing Romarr and opening `http://localhost:9797`, follow these steps to get started.

## Step 1: Set Up a Root Folder

A root folder is where Romarr will store your ROM files.

2. Click **Add Root Folder**
3. Select or type the path to your ROM directory (e.g., `/roms` or `C:\ROMs`)
4. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Configure a Download Client

Romarr needs a download client to fetch ROM files.

1. Go to **Settings > Download Clients**
2. Click the **+** button
3. Select your client (SABnzbd, NZBGet, qBittorrent, Transmission, etc.)
4. Enter the connection details:
   - **Host**: Usually `localhost` or your client's IP
   - **Port**: The client's port
   - **API Key / Password**: Authentication credentials

## Step 3: Add an Indexer

Indexers are where Romarr searches for ROM files.

3. Select the indexer type (Newznab, Torznab, etc.)
4. Enter the indexer URL and API key
5. Click **Test**, then **Save**

## Step 4: Create a Quality Profile

Quality profiles determine which ROM versions Romarr prefers.

1. Go to **Settings > Profiles**

   - **Monitored**: Whether to automatically search for ROMs
5. Click **Add Game**

Romarr will automatically search for and download available ROMs based on your configuration.

## Step 6: Import Existing ROMs
