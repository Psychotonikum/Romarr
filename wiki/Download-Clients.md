## Remote Path Mappings

If your download client and Romarr see files at different paths (e.g., Docker containers, remote machines), configure remote path mappings:

1. Go to **Settings > Download Clients** (scroll to bottom)
2. Add a mapping:
   - **Host**: The download client's host
   - **Remote Path**: Path as the download client sees it (e.g., `/downloads/`)
   - **Local Path**: Path as Romarr sees it (e.g., `/data/downloads/`)

## Completed Download Handling

| **Enable** | Auto-import completed downloads |
| **Remove** | Remove from client after successful import |
| **Check For Finished Downloads** | How often to check (minutes) |

## Failed Download Handling

When a download fails:

1. Romarr marks the release as failed
2. Adds it to the blocklist (won't try the same release again)
3. Searches for an alternative release
4. Downloads the alternative

Configure in **Settings > Download Clients**:
- **Redownload** — Automatically search for alternatives
- **Remove** — Remove failed downloads from the client
